## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Hello circuit py was the first thing we were tasked to do. It is telling the board to blink its neopixel(led) and to print on the serial monitor "make it red!".

Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
import board
import neopixel

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1)
dot.brightness = 0.5 

print("Make it red!")

while True:
    dot.fill((0, 0, 255))
```

### Reflection
So the one thing that was challenging was setting up VS code so it would be able to run circuit python, and the library for the neopixel had to updated. So I had to look at the instruction on canvas and follow them in order to fix my problem. I learned that in order to update a library you need to get the up to date version and drop the specific file you need to update.
What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience?  Your ultimate goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person.

### Reflection
The one thing that was hard was understanding how a servo works. By definition "A Servo Motor is a small device that has an output shaft. This shaft can be positioned to specific angular positions by sending the servo a coded signal. As long as the coded signal exists on the input line, the servo will maintain the angular position of the shaft." So to simplify they have a library that makes it way easier to control a servo motor. I learned this by using Kattni Rembor for Adafruit Industries's code. In his website explains how the code works. https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-bluefruit/circuitpython-servo

### Reflection
The one thing that was hard was getting the colors to fade in and out. I solved this by thinking to myself how I needed to use the greater than and less than. I also asked grant how he used the greater than and less than. He told me that you have to make red a certain distance the same for green and blue.



## CircuitPython_LCD

### Description & Code
This code sets up a counter that increases or decreases its value based on two buttons. The code imports necessary libraries and initializes the I2C LCD screen, two input pins, and the variable num to zero.

The program then enters an infinite loop that checks the state of the buttons. If the first button (connected to pin D3) is held and the second button (connected to pin D2) is pressed, it checks which button was pressed and either increments or decrements the value of num accordingly. The LCD screen is then cleared and the updated value of num is printed.

To prevent multiple counts from being registered when the buttons are held down, a variable called Redo is used to "debounce" the buttons. When a button press is detected, Redo is set to False and the program waits for 0.1 seconds before setting Redo back to True. This ensures that only one count is registered per button press.

The program runs indefinitely until it is manually stopped. The LCD screen displays "Starting" when the program starts, and then displays the updated value of num each time the buttons are pressed.

```python
#Mason Divers
#LCD counter counts up when one button is held and the other buttton is pressed.
#Thank you Kaz Shinozaki for your beautiful code.

### Reflection
Hardest part was trying to get the button to work. When I have used pullup buttons they always seem to work weird. For my solution I needed to have the button be pressed down to count down and press one button to count up.


## CircuitPython_MotorControl

### Description & Code

This code controls a DC motor with a potentiometer by mapping the analog input of the potentiometer to the analog output of the motor. The program imports the necessary libraries and initializes the motor and potentiometer on pins A1 and A0, respectively.

In an infinite loop, the program reads the value of the potentiometer and maps it from the range of 96-65520 to the range of 0-65535 using the simpleio.map_range() function. The mapped value is then printed to the console and written to the motor using the motor.value attribute. The time.sleep() function is used to add a delay of 0.1 seconds between each loop iteration.

As the potentiometer is adjusted, the mapped value sent to the motor changes, allowing for the speed of the motor to be controlled by the potentiometer. The program runs indefinitely until it is manually stopped.

```python
#Mason Divers
#Controlled dc motor with potentiometer. Create a circuit and code to map a potentiometer.
#Code is credited to Grant Gastinger & Kaz Shinozaki
import board               #[lines 1-4] Importing neccesary libraries
import time
from analogio import AnalogOut, AnalogIn
import simpleio

motor = AnalogOut(board.A1) #[lines 5 & 6] Definining the motor and potentiometer
pot = AnalogIn(board.A0)

while True:
    print(simpleio.map_range(pot.value, 96, 65520, 0, 65535)) #Print mapped potentiometer value to motor inputs
    motor.value = int(simpleio.map_range(pot.value, 96, 65520, 0, 65535)) #Write the mapped value to motor
    time.sleep(.1)   
```

## CircuitPython_TemperatureSensor

### Description & Code
This code initializes a temperature sensor (TMP36) and an I2C LCD screen. It then defines a function that converts the analog input from the temperature sensor to temperature in Celsius. The code also sets the minimum and maximum desired temperature range.

The main loop of the code reads the temperature from the TMP36 sensor and converts it to Fahrenheit. It then displays the temperature in Fahrenheit on the first line of the LCD screen and waits for 1 second before clearing the screen. Depending on the temperature, a message is displayed on the second line of the LCD screen. If the temperature is within the desired range, the message "It feels good :)" is displayed. If the temperature is below the desired range, the message "brrr Too Cold!" is displayed. If the temperature is above the desired range, the message "Too Hot!" is displayed. If the temperature is exactly 69.0 to 69.9, the message "Damn its sexy" is displayed. The loop continues to run indefinitely until the program is manually stopped.

```python

import time
import board
import analogio
from lcd.lcd import LCD
from lcd.i2c_pcf8574_interface import I2CPCF8574Interface

# Initialize the TMP36 sensor and the I2C LCD screen
tmp36 = analogio.AnalogIn(board.A0)
i2c = board.I2C()
lcd = LCD(I2CPCF8574Interface(i2c, 0x27), num_rows=2, num_cols=16)


def tmp36_temperature_C(analogin):
    millivolts = analogin.value * (analogin.reference_voltage * 1000 / 65535)
    return (millivolts - 500) / 10

# Define the desired temperature range
min_temp = 70
max_temp = 75

while True:
    # Read the temperature from the TMP36 sensor
    temp_c = tmp36_temperature_C(tmp36)
    temp_f = (temp_c * 9 / 5) + 32

    # Print the temperature
    lcd.print("Temp: {:.1f} F".format(temp_f))
    time.sleep(1)
    lcd.clear()
    
    

    # Print a message on line 2 of the LCD screen depending on the temperature
    if temp_f >= min_temp and temp_f <= max_temp:
        lcd.print("It feels good :)")
    elif temp_f < min_temp:
        lcd.print("brrr Too Cold!")
    elif temp_f <= 69.9 and temp_f >= 69.0:
        lcd.print ("Damn its sexy")
    else:
        lcd.print("Too Hot!")

```

## CircuitPython_RotaryEncoder

### Description & Code
The rotary encoder is connected to two digital pins of the board and generates pulses that are used to determine the direction and amount of rotation. The code uses the rotaryio library to read the encoder position and the board library to initialize the hardware.

The code also uses the digitalio library to read a push button that is connected to another digital pin of the board. When the button is pressed, the code changes the color of a single neopixel LED, based on the current position of the rotary encoder.
The code also uses the neopixel library to initialize the neopixel LED and set its brightness. Finally, the code uses the lcd.lcd library and the i2c_pcf8574_interface library to initialize an LCD display with two rows and sixteen columns. The LCD display is used to print the current color based on the position of the rotary encoder.

```python

## CircuitPython_Photointerrupter

### Description & Code
The given code is a Python script that utilizes the CircuitPython library to interface with a photoelectric sensor (photointerrupter) connected to the D7 pin on a microcontroller board. The script starts by importing the necessary libraries, including "time" for timekeeping, "digitalio" for digital input/output, and "board" for pin mapping.

A digital input pin (photoI) is defined using the "DigitalInOut" class from the digitalio library, and its direction is set to INPUT with a pull-up resistor enabled. A "last_photoI" variable is initialized to True, and a "last_update" variable is set to -4 to keep track of the last time the crossing count was updated.

Inside the while loop, the script checks if the time elapsed since the last update is greater than 4 seconds using "time.monotonic()". If it is, the current number of crosses detected by the photoelectric sensor (photoICrosses) is printed, and the last_update time is updated.

The script then checks if the current value of the photoI pin is different from the last recorded value, and if it is low (indicating a crossing event). If so, the photoICrosses count is incremented by 1, and the last_photoI value is updated.

### Reflection
Overall, the code is to be a basic implementation for detecting crossings using a photoI sensor and keeping track of the number of crossings that occur over time. However, it may need additional error handling, input validation, and other features depending on the specific application or use case.
